## Code Standards
- **Human-Readable**: Code should tell a story
- **Test-Covered**: Every feature needs tests that actually test real scenarios
- **English Documentation**: Comments and docs in clear, professional English
- **Performance-Minded**: Every book query should feel instant

## Commit Message Style
We like commits that tell the human story:
